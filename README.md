# CharlieVM
This is a personal project to write a fully functional processor and assembler.

##Usage
I've included a makefile to compile this from source. It should be cross platform (specifically 32-bit/64-bit systems),but I've only compiled on linux. Assembler takes 2 arguments, input file, output file. Processor can be run with a ROM in the command line or specified immediately after running. 

##Documentation
Take a look at the pdf in the root directory for the processors specs.
